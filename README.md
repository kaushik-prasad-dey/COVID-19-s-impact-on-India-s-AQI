# COVID 19 s-impact-on-India-s-AQI

The air quality index (AQI) is an index for reporting air quality on a daily basis. A low AQI indicates good air quality and low levels of pollution while a higher AQI suggests increased concentrations of pollutants in the air which is extremely detrimental to human health.

The air quality index is composed of 8 pollutants ((PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb)

AQI scores and categories: Good (0–50) Satisfactory (51–100) Moderately polluted (101–200) Poor (201–300) Very poor (301–400) Severe (401–500)

In this notebook, we will be using the day-wise AQI dataset which contains information regarding the daily level of pollutants and AQI in around 26 Indian cities from 2015-2020.

Our main objectives in this notebook:

Finding the most polluted cities in recent years and analysing the levels of pollutants here
Understanding the impact of COVID-19 induced lockdowns on Air Quality in some of the major cities : analysing which cities underwent the most drastic improvement in Air Quality and which cities showed a spike in AQI levels inspite of a stringent lockdown
We'll also be performing time series forecasting with SARIMA- We'll build a model and then try to predict the AQI values into the future.
